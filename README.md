-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1.Capture and Mouse Interaction**:  
    Implement real-time webcam feed capture. 
    Enable interactive drawing of rectangles using mouse events.

**2.Sketch Processing on Live Feed:**
    Apply edge detection to generate a sketch effect on live video.
    
**3.Car and Pedestrian Detection:**
    Detect cars and pedestrians using pre-trained HAAR Cascade and HOG classifiers.
    Highlight detected objects with bounding boxes.

**4.Face and Eye Detection with HAAR Cascade:**
    Perform real-time detection of faces and eyes using OpenCV's HAAR Cascade Classifiers.
    Mark detected regions with bounding boxes for visualization.

**5.Face and Eye Detection from Videos:**
    Process pre-recorded video files for face and eye detection.

**6.Image Handling:**
    Read images from the local file system.
    Display images with OpenCV.
    Save processed images for further analysis.
